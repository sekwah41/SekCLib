# SekCore Library

## Features
 * Capability @Sync annotations

## Planned
 * Animations
 * Ragdoll Physics

## Utilities
Not fully fledged features but just small utilities in the com.sekwah.util package I use between my mods.
Not all are mentioned here but I will mention the main ones
 * Color Utils (Color wheel + java.awt.Color to mc colors)
 * Player Utils (Easy server -> client velocity + fix inconsistencies)
 * Shape Utils (For rotating and splitting shapes mostly for multiblock tiles.)

## Will you add fabric support?
As of this time we do not plan to support Fabric,
though we will take a look into it in the future once we have the core features finished.
As most of my mods are using this library or are moving over to using this library.
