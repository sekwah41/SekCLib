# SekCore Library

This mod is a library mod used to help speed up dev and provide helpful common functions primarily used across Sekwah's mods.

Fabric support is not currently planned at this time though once more features have been added it may be considered.

## Features
 * Capability @Sync annotations

## Planned
 * Animations
 * Ragdoll Physics

## Utilities
Not fully fledged features but just small utilities in the com.sekwah.util package I use between my mods.
Not all are mentioned here but I will mention the main ones
 * Color Utils (Color wheel + java.awt.Color to mc colors)
 * Player Utils (Easy server -> client velocity + fix inconsistencies)

## Will you add fabric support?
As of this time we do not plan to support Fabric,
though we will take a look into it in the future once we have the core features finished.
As most of my mods are using this library or are moving over to using this library.

# If you need help
Please contact us on our [discord](https://discord.sekwah.com/).

# Examples
I will link examples as I switch other mods of my own over to doing multi-platform.

I will also at some point setup the forge-testmod, fabric-testmod and core-testmod as another example to also allow for basic testing of the library during dev.
